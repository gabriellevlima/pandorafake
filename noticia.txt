But these successes have taken decades to achieve - and many of us are now expecting effective coronavirus vaccines to have similar results in a radically shorter time frame.

News that some of the emerging vaccines are more than 90% effective - meaning about nine in 10 people receiving them would be protected from developing Covid-19 - has led many to believe we could soon be ditching social distancing and throwing away our face masks.

In the US and the UK, where regulatory approval for the jabs is being granted quickly and mass vaccination programmes planned, some have even suggested life could be back to normal by spring.

But many scientists and global health experts are warning that vaccines, with limited initial supplies and roll-out to selected groups, although protecting vulnerable groups and front-line health workers, are unlikely to transport us back to our old way of living anytime soon.

Tedros Ghebreyesus, head of the WHO, has said as much himself.

"A vaccine will complement the other tools we have, not replace them," he said. "A vaccine on its own will not end the pandemic."
